# 📈 Stock Portfolio Tracker

This is a simple Python project developed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. The Stock Portfolio Tracker allows users to input their stock holdings and calculates the total investment using hardcoded stock prices.

---

## ✅ Features

- User inputs stock names and quantities
- Hardcoded dictionary of stock prices (e.g., AAPL = $180, TSLA = $250)
- Calculates total investment
- Optionally saves the result to a `.txt` or `.csv` file

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Core Concepts: `dictionary`, `input/output`, `loops`, `file handling`, `basic arithmetic`

---

## 📥 Input

- Users enter stock symbols like `AAPL`, `TSLA`, etc.
- Users provide the quantity they hold for each stock
- Type `done` to finish entering stocks

```
Example:
Enter stock symbol: AAPL  
Enter quantity of AAPL: 10  
Enter stock symbol: TSLA  
Enter quantity of TSLA: 5  
Enter stock symbol: done
```

---

## 📤 Output

Console Output:
```
📊 Investment Summary:
AAPL: 10 shares × $180 = $1800
TSLA: 5 shares × $250 = $1250

💰 Total Investment: $3050
```
